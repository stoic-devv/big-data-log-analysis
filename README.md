# Big data log analysis

In this project we leverage Hadoop's map-reduce framework to do analysis of an application log file in a [virtual machine](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox.html) and in [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/). The log file we examine is a generated one. More details about log generation project can be found [here](https://github.com/0x1DOCD00D/LogFileGenerator).
This project is done as a part of CS 441 - Distributed Cloud Objects at UIC, by [Dr. Mark](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~drmark/).  <br />
